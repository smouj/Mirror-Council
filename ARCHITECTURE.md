## Core idea
This skill focuses on **multi-agent** capabilities for OpenClaw agents.

## Runtime flow
1. Input goal validation
2. Scope filtering and constraints
3. Safe execution planning
4. Execution with guardrails
5. Verification and report

## Components
- Interface: `SKILL.md` / `SKILL.es.md`
- Documentation: `README.md` / `README.es.md`
- Policy: `LIMITS.md`
- Practical patterns: `USE_CASES.md`

## Observability
- explicit checks
- fail-safe behavior
- concise post-run report
